        Walk five minutes from the station and the modern world fades away. You are stepping onto cobblestones
        that have carried merchants, painters, and explorers for over 700 years. Here, history isn’t locked behind
        glass; it’s in the leaning facades reflecting in the Spaarne, in the hidden courtyards (hofjes) where time
        seems to stand still, and in the legends that echo through the narrow alleyways.
