            Walk five minutes from the station and the modern world fades away. You are stepping onto cobblestones that have carried merchants, painters, and explorers for over 700 years. Here, history isn’t locked behind glass; it’s in the leaning facades reflecting in the Spaarne, in the hidden courtyards (hofjes) where time seems to stand still, and in the legends that echo through the narrow alleyways.
