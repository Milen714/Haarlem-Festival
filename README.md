# Haarlem Festival

> ⚠️ **Important:** This README is submitted separately. You **must clone the repository** from GitHub to get the full codebase, then follow these instructions to set it up locally.

A full-stack web application built for the Haarlem Festival — a multi-day event in the city of Haarlem featuring jazz, dance, magic, and food. This app handles everything from browsing events and buying tickets to managing the festival through an admin CMS. It was built as a school project at Hogeschool Inholland.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for Tailwind CSS)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (optional if you want to run things outside Docker)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Haarlem-Festival
```

This step is **required** — the README alone is not sufficient to run the application.

### 2. Set up your environment

> **Note:** Due to a 100 MB submission limit, the `.env` files and `DatabaseDump.sql` are submitted separately. Follow the steps below to set them up.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Place the provided `.env` files in **BOTH locations**:

```bash
# Place the provided .env file in the root directory
.env

# Place the same provided .env file (or a copy) in the app directory
app/.env
```

Both directories need the same `.env` file with:

- MySQL / Aiven database credentials
- Stripe API keys (public + secret)
- Gmail SMTP credentials
- Google Maps API key
- Google reCAPTCHA keys

The provided `DatabaseDump.sql` file should be imported into your database to populate it with sample data.

### 3. Install Composer dependencies

From the app directory, install all PHP dependencies:

```bash
cd app
docker compose run --rm php composer install
```

### 4. Start Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This spins up Nginx, PHP-FPM, PhpMyAdmin, Stripe CLI (for local webhook testing), and the cron container.

The app will be available at `http://localhost`.
PhpMyAdmin is available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 5. Configure Stripe webhooks

The Stripe CLI container automatically forwards webhook events to your local app. After Docker starts, grab the webhook signing secret it generates:

```bash
docker-compose logs stripe-cli | grep "webhook signing secret"
```

Copy the `whsec_...` value and paste it into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in both `.env` and `app/.env`. Without this step, payments will process but order confirmation won't trigger.

### 6. Start the CSS watcher

In a separate terminal from the project root:

```bash
cd app && npm run watch
```

> Keep this running while you develop — Tailwind won't generate styles without it.

## Troubleshooting

### CSS not working?

Run the Tailwind watcher from the project root:

```bash
cd app && npm run watch
```

If that doesn't work on Windows:

```bash
cd .\app\
cmd /c npm run watch
```

Keep this terminal running while developing.

### Stripe webhooks not firing locally?

The Docker setup includes the Stripe CLI. Make sure your `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `app/.env` matches the secret output by the Stripe CLI container.
