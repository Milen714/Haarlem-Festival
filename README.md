## ⚠️ **CSS NOT WORKING?**

### **Run the following command from the project root:**

```bash
cd .\app\ && npm run watch
```

### **If it's not working:**

```bash
cd .\app\
cmd /c npm run watch
```

This starts the Tailwind CSS watcher and generates the required CSS files. Keep this terminal running while developing.
